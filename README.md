# 3p-SDL3

[Simple DirectMedia Layer](SDL/docs/README.md) is a cross-platform development library designed
to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics
hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

# How to build:

* Install [autobuild](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/Autobuild) utility.
* Invoke autobuild at the command line:

```      
        autobuild build
        autobuild package

```
That will produce a bundled asset of SDL3 libs and header files called something like: `SDL3-3.22.0-linux-012345678.tar.bz2`
